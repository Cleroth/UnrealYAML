# UnrealYAML: A Unreal-Compatible Wrapper for the yaml-cpp Library

Welcome to the UnrealYAML Plugin, a Plugin that allows the parsing and emitting of YAML files, based on the [yaml-cpp Library](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp)

**Important Node: ** The Plugin is far from finished and needs more testing, bug fixing and features to become fully usable and to work natively in Unreal! Feel free to contribute

## Implemented Features
- Basic Functionality of the Node class (Assignment, Creating a YAML structure)
- Conversion to and from most frequently used Unreal Types

## TODO
- Wrapper class for the Emitter
- Iterators
- Better Stability
- More conversions
